# Chapter 01 : 📊 Counting Principles in Probability

Welcome to the ** Chapter 01 ** repository! This project is designed to help you understand and apply fundamental counting principles in probability.

  - **Combinations**
  - **Special Cases**
  - **Examples**

# 1- Sample Space 🎲
  - a sample space (sometimes denoted as 𝑆 or Ω) is the set of all possible outcomes of a particular experiment.
  - **Examples:**

# 3- **The Addition Principle ➕**
  - The Addition Principle helps you count the number of ways to perform one of several tasks when those tasks are mutually exclusive. It states that if there are 𝑛 ways to perform Task 1, and 𝑚 ways to perform 
    Task 2, and the two tasks cannot happen at the same time, then there are **𝑛 + 𝑚** ways to perform either Task 1 or Task 2.
    
  - **Examples:**
    
    - Imagine you have a choice between two types of sandwiches and three types of salads. The number of ways to choose either a sandwich or a salad is:
         **Soluation ** --> 2 + 3 = 5

      
# 4- **Factorial ❗** 
  - Factorials are used to count the number of ways to arrange a set of distinct items.
    
   - **Examples:**
