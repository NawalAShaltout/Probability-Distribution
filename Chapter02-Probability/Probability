### 1. 🌐 Sample Space (S)
  - The sample space is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.
  - **Example 01 : Flipping a Coin**
    - If you flip a fair coin, the sample space consists of two possible outcomes:
    
            S = {H, T}
    
  - **Example 02: Rolling a Die**
    - If you roll a fair six-sided die, the sample space consists of six possible outcomes:

           S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

### 2. 🎯 Event (E)
             
  - An event is a subset of the sample space, consisting of one or more outcomes. For instance, getting a Heads in a coin toss is an event.
  - **Example: Flipping a Coin**
    - If you are interested in the event of getting heads when flipping a coin, the event **A** can be represented as:

          A = {H}
    
  - **Example: Rolling a Die**
    - If you are interested in the event of rolling an even number, the event **B** can be represented as:
          
          B = {2, 4, 6}
